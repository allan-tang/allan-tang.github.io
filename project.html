                        	Over the summer, I interned at James Loudspeaker independently revamping their website to fit the growing needs of the company. I removed the old website and put in a Rails framework. I also cleaned and migrated their old database so that all their products were up to date.

                        	For my semester project in CS169 Software Engineering, I collaborated with a group of wonderful people to streamline the process of EFF's healthy lifestyle program. At EFF, employees were rewarded for doing a healthy activity every day and reporting their exercise. However, the tallying was done through email at the end of month and the process became cumbersome.

                        	<p>
                        	We wrote a web application for employees to sign in and log in their hours. All records would be tallied, the adminstrator can view, approve, and deny employee activities, and a PDF is automatically generated to send to HR.

                        	CS classes are getting larger due their popularity, making it hard for professors and TA's to fit the needs of the students. To counter this, I joined a group of CS370 students and together we created a new student organization which pairs previous students who have taken the course to mentor students who are currently struggling in the course. As an organization, we teach students how to be effective mentors so that they may pass their experience and knowledge to those who need it.

                        	As Head Senior Mentor for CS61A, I've collaborated with other course staff and mentors to help write worksheets to streamline the tutoring and provided guidance and teaching tips to students who aspire to be teachers but don't have the experience. This semester, we have helped more than 400 students combined from CS61A and CS61B and are continuing to grow in other lower division CS courses.

                        		It's hard logistically to manage so many mentors in the organzation. One of the main problems was finding a good way to pair up students who are currently taking the course to a mentor at a regular time slot once a week for one hour. Many students have different schedules and finding a fair and proper way to sort out the student's preferences was a hard task to do by hand.
                        	</p>

                        	<p>
 								Our organzation's solution was to write a scheduler that would allow students to sign up for a time slot that they want, based on the avaliability of the mentors. The application would also send emails to the students to confirm their time slot, notify them of where to meet based on room avaliability, and who would be their designated mentor. 
                        	</p>

                        	<p>
                        		I spearheaded the creation of the application and led a software team to develop the application in time for next semester. I delegated tasks and managed communcation between the organzation and my team to ensure that the application worked properly with the needs of the organzation. You can check out the front page of the application at <a href="http://csmscheduler.herokuapp.com"> csmscheduler.herokuapp.com </a>
